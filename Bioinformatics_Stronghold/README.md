### List of solved tasks

* [Counting DNA Nucleotides](Counting_DNA_Nucleotides.py) -  the function that counts the nucleotides present in the given DNA sequence.
* [Transcribing DNA into RNA](Transcribing_DNA_into_RNA.py) - the function that transcribed DNA sequence into RNA sequence. 
* [Complementing a Strand of DNA](Complementing_Strand_of_DNA.py) - the function that outputs the reverse complement of the given DNA sequence.
* [Mendel's First Law](Mendels_first_law.py) - the function that returns the probability that two randomly selected mating organisms will produce an individual possessing a dominant allele.
* [Counting point mutations](Counting_point_mutations.py) - the function that calculates the Hamming distance between two sequences of equal length
* [Computing GC Content](Computing_GC_content.py) - the function that opens .fasta files and then calculates the GC content of each sequence and returns the ID of the sequence with the highest GC content and its value
* [Translating RNA into Protein](Translating_RNA_into_protein.py) - the function that return the protein string encoded by RNA sequence
* [Finding a motif in DNA](Finding_motif_in_DNA.py) - the function that return all locations of sequence t as a substring of sequence s
* [Enumerating Gene Orders](Enumerating_Gene_Orders.py) - the function that return number of possible permutations and possible rearrangements of genes order
* [Rabbits and Recurrence Relations](Rabbits_and_Recurrence_Relations.py) - the function that return the total number of rabbits that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair)
